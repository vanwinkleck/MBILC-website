						<h1>Introduction</h1>
					</header>
					<p>We created this website because we wanted not only to share our experience with the class, but also with others who may be interested in how service in your community can improve you as a person and lead to some very deep personal realizations. We hope this webpage can serve as an informative resource, but also a collection of 3 personal stories that may inspire someone to take action within their own neighborhood, and share some of the life-changing and formative experiences we had.</p>
					<p>Over our short time performing service at Mullanphy, much was learned. Not only by the kids we coached, but I'd venture to say they might have taught us more than we taught them. Small things such as what kind of games kids play today, what they’re interested in, and what shows they watch. But more than that, we learned how to become not just mentors, but also role models. Having a group of young people listen to what we have to say, and even look up to us was a new experience for all three of us, but one we both enjoyed and cherished. </p>
					<p>The very first words in the Vatican’s reading: “Giving the best of yourself: a Document on the Christian perspective on sport and the human person, from the Dicastery for Laity, Family and Life” say that “Giving one's very best is a fundamental theme in sports, as athletes both individually and collectively strive to achieve their goals in the game. When a person gives his very best, he experiences satisfaction and the joy of accomplishment.” (Vatican 1.1) We believe that, through our semester of coaching within our own community, that this idea of sport bringing out the best of yourself happens not only when practicing or in game, but also find their way into your everyday life. Participating in sport whether it be through playing or coaching, leads one to take the ideals of bettering oneself and giving their all into everything they do in life, whether it be school, occupation, or even just striving to become the best possible person you can be.</p>

					Throughout our service project at Mullanphy Botanical Gardens Elementary School this semester, I faced many situations where I was challenged to step up as a leader and help engage the children in the soccer program. During our first few visits to the school, I felt anxious and somewhat uncomfortable as I had never ventured into this area of Saint Louis or participated in much other community service. Kristin Sheehan states “we win as athletes, coaches, and parents when we understand that the score on the scoreboard is not the most important thing in sport” (Youth Sport and Spirituality, 196). In the first few practices, I was challenged by the task of keeping the players under control and making sure they were playing the game correctly. I noticed a few of the children were arguing during our scrimmages about losing their first game and how one of the boys missed a wide-open goal. They continued to quarrel over how many goals they had scored and I could sense the animosity between the team as some of the players were pushing one another or even crying.  In turn, I began reflecting on this quote, so that I could apply it to our current situation. In the following practices, we focused on motivating the children to work together as a team and to pay less attention to personal statistics and the score at the end of the game. We began advising the importance of team chemistry and passing the ball to each teammate, so everyone has an equal opportunity to enjoy the game. As a result, we noticed, the children were becoming less selfish in their playing styles and their ball movement improved subsequently. My initial feelings of uneasiness slowly dissipated each week as the kids started to embrace us as their coaches and respect us. I started to look forward to each practice with exuberance because I knew that we were making an impact in these kids’ lives and they were always ecstatic to see us. I am extremely grateful for the opportunity to take part in this program because it taught me a lot about myself in the process, as well as how I can influence the lives of others. </p>
					<p>In What is Ignatian Spirituality, David Fleming writes “God will point [us] in new directions. We need to always stay alert and seize the opportunities we have every day.” During our project I began to realize that God presented me with the ability to take part in this soccer program and I decided to make the most out of each practice I spent at Mullanphy. My initial feelings of uneasiness slowly dissipated each week as the kids started to embrace us as their coaches and respect us. I started to look forward to each practice with exuberance because I knew that we were making an impact in these kids’ lives and they were always ecstatic to see us. I am extremely grateful for the opportunity to take part in this program. This project has taught me so much about myself and my ability to help others, so I am planning to get more involved in volunteering in the future!</p>

					The time I spent spent at Mullanphy Botanical Gardens Elementary School really challenged me throughout the semester. Hearing about this area in the news and from some people of Saint Louis, I would be lying if I said I was not a little concerned about my safety. I was not looking forward to having to add service work to my already busy workload. Fleming described my feelings about the service perfectly in What Is Ignatian Spirituality on page 15 when he writes, “[W]e commonly say about someone who shows no enthusiasm for a project that ‘his heart isn’t in it,’” (Fleming, 15).  Between school, homework, just trying to live, and being on the more reserved side, going out into an unknown area is not what I would consider fun or even worthwhile to me. I had no desires to go out and do any of this. But, that all honestly changed after the first week or two. I never felt like I was in any danger and my mindset changed. The kids at Mullanphy were so excited when we arrived the first week and each week after that it made me rethink about my feelings toward this project. In the paper “Giving the Best of Yourself” from the Vatican, they write, “Such experiences can help young people to realize that they are a part of something larger than themselves and be a part of what gives meaning and purpose to their lives,” (Giving The Best of Yourself, 5.5). Each week left me with new experiences because the kids always had something new and these made me realize that my group and I were really helping these kids. With each experience came more challenges thought. Most of them were kids arguing about someone not passing them the ball or that they were “tired” of playing soccer so it became a challenge every once in a while, to keep everyone interested, especially the younger ones! In the end, it was one of the coolest experiences I have had at Saint Louis University because it taught me a decent amount of real world experience and problems!</p>

					Personally, through my experience volunteering with the youth soccer program, i’ve found that the children in the age range we usually work with (1st-4th grade) are at a very crucial point in their development. This is a time in their life where who they are to become later on is determined. Not to say that people can’t change, but the things children learn at this age usually determine how they will develop into adults. This is why it’s so important to teach them fundamental values and morals at this age.</p>
					<p>In my few weeks volunteering at Mullanphy, I’ve seen first hand how kids can hold these values, and some kids still need to learn them. One of the most interesting experiences I’ve had so far is with a 1st grader during a small practice. He would participate very well for the first 20 minutes during our scrimmage game, but after a while he walked over to the corner by himself for no explicit reason. When I noticed this, I went over to talk to him and asked what the matter was. He told me “Everyone else is scoring more goals than me, and all I want is to be the best player on the team”. This struck me, and would become something I thought back on many times through our service. I wanted to know why he felt this way, and why his strive to be the best on the team led him to tears. So while this young man had the competitive drive and spirit we look for, he didn't hold the values of teamwork and being part of something greater than yourself.</p>
					<p>Another experience that shaped my time volunteering was becoming a role model to some of the kids. Every practice a group of 4 students would come up to me and fight for my attention. Each always had something they were very excited to tell me, whether it be something that happened at school earlier in the week, a new thing about soccer they learned, or just something funny their friend had said earlier in the day. It was a new experience for me to have so many kids look up to me as someone they wanted to impress or even just talk to. While I have a baby brother, and he’s very affectionate towards me, he’s non-verbal and can’t express his feelings or thoughts to me. So being around so many children who could express themselves to me and ask advice was a new, but welcome experience.</p>
					<p>In this new role of mentor I found myself in, I learned what it means to set an example for a child who needs one. You have to watch what you do, say, and even how you carry yourself. I tried to be an exemplar of what it means to be a stand-up young man, and someone these kids could model themselves after. While there were hiccups, I found this to be very rewarding and one of my favorite parts of the semester. I looked forward to going to the school every Wednesday and seeing my team, having fun and helping them in any way I could. I like to think I at least imparted some wisdom on them, but the real treasure I gained from my weeks of service was learning how to be a better role model, and even a better person. If I act this way around my team, why don’t I act like this all the time? Learning how to be a more caring and understanding person, and how to deal with tough situations and mediating between two people.</p>
					<p>Finally, to give a general overview of the more minute details of my experience, we spent much of our time teaching the children basic soccer skills, doing things such as passing, lateral movement, and shooting drills. Some days we would play scrimmage games with the four coaches spread out among the two teams. We would try our best to use our age and higher level of skill to try and teach the kids how to “read” the game during these scrimmages. Trying to teach them to open their eyes, look for passes, and look for the optimal play in a situation. While not everyone caught on, there were some who really excelled at this, and I honestly believe they could make fine soccer players one day. There was a very large skill gap between the “natural” players on the team and the ones who weren’t so talented. However, this didn’t stop everyone from having fun. We would find ways to include the less skilled such as challenging the better players to look for assists instead of goals, and showing them how to block a shot or play keeper. Overall, this was my first time being a coach, and I had so much fun and learned so many new things that I could see myself doing it again someday, maybe even sometime in the near future. </p>
