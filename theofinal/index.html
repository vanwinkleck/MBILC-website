						<p><i>“The fight is far from over, because it is neither won, as some assert, nor lost, as the calamity-ridden declare...”. While our semester of service at Mullanphy may be over, our goal from reaching our potential is far from it. There are still many things about ourselves we must learn, and many things we must improve. The goal of making this website, was to inform others outside of our class that they too can have these life-changing experiences similar to ours, and that they should realize that not trying to actualize their full potential as a person would be a mistake, and one that they would regret for the rest of their lives. We wanted to use this page as a medium to get across our own encounters in the space between, and how they served to better us as coaches, but more importantly, as people.</i> </p>
