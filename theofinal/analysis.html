						<h1>Analysis</h1>
					</header>
					<p>In “Giving the Best of Yourself,” the Vatican says “the harmonious development of the person in their physical, social, spiritual and dimensions has long been recognized as contributing to psychological health and human flourishing” (Vatican, 3.6). From the readings and our engagement at Mullanphy, we learned how our interactions spur our development towards well-rounded growth. Many of these children at Mullanphy lack mentors in their lives, so we stepped up into this role as soccer coaches. During this project, we incorporated our leadership and soccer knowledge to cultivate growth in all areas of the kids’ lives. We needed to teach them life lessons and show them how to carry themselves in a loving demeanor that promoted flourishing in their lives.  One of the most useful methods of prayer from Ignatius is the examen. David Fleming describes the examen as “an indispensable tool to realize the purpose of the Spiritual Exercises – to detect God’s presence and to discern his will through close attention to the subtle interior movements of God’s spirit” (What is Ignatian Spirituality, 20). The examen has been particularly effective in helping us to review our day and thank God for all the gifts he has given us during our life. We have become more appreciative of the sacrifices that our parents made to get us to this point in our life and we feel more motivated to achieve greatness and help those around us. Fleming also writes “God will point [us] in new directions. We need to always stay alert and seize the opportunities we have every day” (What is Ignatian Spirituality, 33). This quote correlates to our personal experience in the “space between” because after analyzing some of Ignatius’s reflective prayers and techniques, we have a greater understanding of our mission as children of God and how to use each of our gifts to their fullest extent. Realizing our gifts and understanding how to use them is foundationally significant in our ability to transform the community. By putting in the effort to recognize our personal strengths and weaknesses, we are better able to work with those around us in the community. Since everyone has their own areas of excellence and shortcomings, reflection allows us to realize how we can work together with one another and combine our gifts from God to improve the world each day.</p>
					<p>Another quote that really grabbed our attention from the book was from Richard Gaillardetz on page 157 as he states, “there is an element of self-forgetfulness in genuine play… this is particularly evident when we watch children at play.” On our first day at Mullanphy Botanical, we noticed only a few of the players had proper athletic clothing for practice, as most students were wearing their school uniforms. This was eye-opening to us because we had never experienced this on our childhood sports teams. But, even though many of the kids at Mullanphy Botanical did not have athletic clothing, we could tell they still love to play the game of soccer just as much as any other child from more affluent economic backgrounds. After watching these children just purely enjoy themselves through soccer, regardless of their economic backgrounds or situations at home, we began to truly experience how powerful sport can truly be in giving children and adults the opportunity to express themselves and escape from the stress in their lives at school or home.</p>
					<p>In What is Ignatian Spirituality, David Fleming passionately writes that “lovers share what they have with the beloved” (page 63). This passage is significant to our engagement at Mullanphy because it shows that all humans have a responsibility to love one another and share their gifts with those that are less fortunate with them. At Mullanphy, we were are able to share our knowledge of soccer so that we could improve the after-school program and show these kids how to work together as a team. By sharing our wisdom with these kids, we hope they use this knowledge in other aspects of their life such as schoolwork and at home. </p>
					<p>Fleming also writes "Everyone can help. Helping does not require extensive training and a fistful of academic degrees. Very young people can help; so can the very old (What is Ignatian Spirituality, 104). We experienced this first hand in our service project as neither of us had an extensive background in soccer, but we were still able to provide joy to the kids each day we showed up. In order to erase the negativity surrounding our world and bring disconnected communities together, it takes an effort from everyone regardless of their age or experience. Just by putting forth the effort to engage in conversation with the coaches, parents, players, and other volunteers at Mullanphy, we were able to learn about their mindsets and apply them to our lives. As we started to assist the children and teach them important virtues, we discerned how sports can integrate societies and establish a foundation for living out the will of God in our occupations, schoolwork, and relationships. </p>
					<p>Martin Luther King writes that “the great majority of Americans… are uneasy with injustice but unwilling yet to pay a significant price to eradicate it.”  This quote reiterates one of our main discussions at the beginning of the year in this class on how many people view volunteering as a beneficial movement, but they do not take time out of their schedule to engage in service themselves. In on our time at Mullanphy Botanical, we have realized the importance of working together and putting forth the effort required to make social change possible, and in doing so we believe that we have begun to break down the barriers that divide Saint Louis racially and economically.  On page 196, King writes "we must rapidly begin the shift from a "thing"-oriented society to a "person"-oriented society" (Where Do We Go from Here) and we feel that this quote relates more heavily to our modern world. In order for our country to come together, we cannot be so focused on material possessions such as iPhones, laptops, luxury clothes, and other machines. We need to embrace one another and grow as a community where love is at the root of our existence. At Mullanphy, we witnessed poverty from a new perspective and learned to appreciate personal connections and the ability to make a difference through our actions. </p>
					<p>The Vatican writes “each human being is created in God’s image and likeness and has the right to lead their life with dignity and to be treated with respect” (Giving the Best of Yourself, 33). At Mullanphy, we able to teach this message by letting each player know that they were all teammates and had to understand each other’s capabilities. Soccer gave us the opportunity to show these kids how valuable the skills of cooperation and teamwork can be in not only excelling on the soccer field, but in all areas of life. God calls for us to love each one of our neighbors as ourselves, and we instilled this message at Mullanphy by explaining to the kids that they must love each of their teammates. </p>
					<p>	Kelly says in his text “Youth sport and Spirituality” that “...This is why philosophers have stressed that sport can be an important arena for the development of virtue. Sports provide, in a very public way, occasions for good and evil.” (Kelly, Chapter 4) At first one might see the good as his own team, and the evil as the opposition, but this is not entirely true. This would almost certainly be the first thing young children would assume, but if you could somehow work through their heads that the good was performing the right action at the right time and the evil performing the wrong action or no action at all, this creates a space for self-improvement. This causes the children to think critically about what they’re doing, and why they’re doing it. Kelly goes on to say that “It is rare, in sports at least, that one knows the right thing to do”. (Kelly, chapter 4) Teaching this simple notion to children can not only make them feel better about themselves, but also be able to work more closely as a team, as they can understand that sometimes your teammates will make mistakes, and it may have been just because they did what they thought was right. </p>
					<p>Earlier, in chapter 3, Kelly says that “Sports are a social activity and provide an opportunity for youth to develop social assets that may transfer into different domains...participation in structured sports opportunities also leads to the development of social assets such as teamwork, conflict management, cooperation, decision making, social capital, leadership, and the ability to make meaningful, close relationships.”. (Kelly, Chapter 3) While I personally don’t agree with calling these skills “assets” I believe that sports are a phenomenal, if not the best way to learn these virtues. Through sport, children get to experience these concepts first hand, instead of just hearing adults talk about them and why they should hold them to be true. Through sport, children learn why they should be cooperative with their team, why they should avoid conflict, and so on and so forth. I would go so far as to say this is the best way to learn these virtues in the modern day, whereas in previous times it may have been found much later in life through battle or belonging to an army. </p>
					<p>Again from chapter 4, Kelly quotes a philosopher named Ray Elliot, who said “A child at school finds a subject attractive and begins to look forward to the lessons in which it is taught”. (Kelly, Chapter 4)  This quote validates what I stated in my previous paragraph, and reiterates that children want to learn what their interested in. While they may perform well in subjects they don’t have a stake in, the things they truly learn are subjects and values they are really interested in. Whether this be sports, video games, math, or literally almost anything you can teach to them, a child will always have his favorite subject. Using these subjects to pass down values and social skills while still teaching well about the subject is the goal of all good teachers/coaches. Sports happen to be a very popular subject for kids in our culture, so a lot of our youth learn these crucial values and skills through this medium.</p>
					<p>Through these selections from “Youth Sport and Spirituality”, It’s easy to see how using sports to instill values in our youth can be a very successful way to help them become their best selves. Teaching kids through their favorite medium will increase their interest in what they’re learning, as they have a vested interest in what they’re participating in. Sport also provides a first-hand method of learning these values, through competition and practice. Working hard, staying calm under pressure, and many more virtues can be learned through sport with coaches having to say very little, if anything at all. These virtues come naturally through sport, and while a coach can guide a player along the right path, it is also very possible for a player to discover these himself.</p>
					<p>As we progressed through the semester, we were able to start answering this question from, What is Ignatian Spirituality. Fleming wrote, “Why do we do what we do?” (Fleming, 3). At a glance, this seems like a very simple question, but if we think about it deeper, we come up with the answers Ignatius was most likely looking for. Without this question in mind, our work at Mullanphy would have really meant nothing other than giving the kids a random person to talk to once a week for an hour and a half to two hours. Seems pretty meaningless. With what Fleming wrote in mind, our work there became more meaningful because we decided we were there to make a difference. We wanted to be a figure the kids looked up to as role models and we wanted the kids at Mullanphy to feel like they could trust us and talk with us if they needed someone to listen to them. We wanted to make a difference in their lives. Another question Fleming wrote is, “What is our work in this world all about?” (Fleming, 3). After some time at our site, this was also a question we could answer. The kids at Mullanphy made it pretty easy to find an answer to this question as well. They helped us understand that our work should be more than just worrying about getting done or getting paid. They helped us understand that our work should focus more on the teaching aspect. If we could help at least one kid each week, we accomplished our work for the week. The encounters with the kids each week really helped teach us about how the community needs everyone to work together. As King wrote on page 202, “We still have a choice today: nonviolent coexistence or violent annihilation. This may well be mankind’s last chance to choose between chaos and community,” (King, 202).  Without people working together the community would not exist and it would be impossible for a city or community to flourish let alone anyone living in it! </p>
