					<p>Martin Luther King writes, “today our very survival depends on our ability to stay awake, to adjust to new ideas, to remain vigilant and to face the challenge of change” (Where Do We Go from Here, 33). This quote reveals the significance of personal encounters “in the space between” and it relates to the perception of our interactions at Mullanphy. By pushing ourselves to make the most out of each soccer practice that we spent at the school, we started to discern the purpose of service and life in general. In order to develop as humans, we must face uncomfortable situations and we must persevere through challenges if we want to achieve our goals. Realizing our weaknesses and strengths is critical in promoting communal transformation because we all have faults, but if we band together and share our talents with one another, we can accomplish anything. Another quote from King that describes this transcendence is “when a people are mired in oppression, they realize deliverance when they have accumulated the power to promote change” (Where Do We Go from Here, 144).  This quote is significant because through self-reflection we have noticed how oppression can affect everyone, but in order to escape that oppression we must take advantage of all the opportunities provided to us and make the most out of each one. In doing so, we can evolve and learn to embrace each other as children of God and live out each day to the fullest.</p>
					<p>Leadership and communication were among other important lessons learned from our experiences. In "Giving the best of yourself", they write, "The Church recognizes her shared responsibility with sports leaders to point out wrong directions taken and unethical behavior and to steer sport in a way that promotes human development," (Vatican, 1.3). Since we have a background playing sports, we knew how important leadership is to accomplishing anything and succeeding as a team. The only problem with leadership and a bunch of little kids is that the kids tend to like to do their own things and not listen to the leaders, so we had to come up with ways to combat that. One of the best ways to get the kids to listen was by threatening to make an individual sit out for a certain amount of time or make the whole group stop for a given amount of time. This usually did the trick as the kids loved playing soccer, especially when they played versus/with us. If the threat of not being able to play did not work, we would actually sit them out, usually for like a minute or two. We only had to do this once or twice. To be the leaders we were striving to be, we had to teach the kids more than just about soccer. King writes, "Ultimately a genuine leader is not a searcher for consensus but a molder of consensus," (King, 65). We were there to teach the lessons you can learn behind sports such as sportsmanship or teamwork, not to just watch them and make sure they played fair and did not hurt each other. One kid in particular stuck out as being a little harder to reach. He struggled to play fair because he thought no one would pass him the ball. Well, no one passed him the ball because he would try and steal it from them, even if they were on the same team. With some teaching, the kid learned that his team will pass him the ball if he gets open. As Nitin Nohria wrote in Youth Sport and Spirituality, "Communication is the real work of leadership," and it definitely took a ton of communication for us to be able to be the leaders we were trying to be (Kelly, 234)!</p>
					<p>To transcend past the space between, you must realize the value inherent within yourself, and within your community. The Vatican reading believes that sports are an exceptional way to do this, stating that “The profound meaning of sport is that it can educate to the fullness of life and an openness to the experience of transcendence.” (Vatican 5.2). Sport does this through teaching one about his limits and building himself up, while also forming strong bonds and relationships with your teammates around you. Once you realize the value in your teammates, you stop being just a group of individuals playing together, and actually become the team. This can be applied outside sports as well, but for a significant number of people, their first experience with transcending the self comes from sport. As for transformation, once the team becomes one unit, it’s easy to notice that the dynamics of the community change, things run smoother, and more efficiently. Players no longer have to speak to each other to make complicated plays happen, they can simply just do it because they know how their teammates think and how they like to play. There is less squabbling and more understanding between each other. </p>
					<p>Crossing over into the “space between” was the core subject of this course where everything we learned tied back together into. The personal encounters we found in the space between were really what caused the formative and influential experiences we had during our time with service. Doing something bigger than ourselves and being a part of something that means just as much to others as it did to us. These encounters are what led us to strive to improve not only our service, but ourselves. Connecting with the children through sport is what allowed us to have these meetings in the space between, and without sport, I imagine it would have been much harder to form these connections, if we even could at all. </p>
