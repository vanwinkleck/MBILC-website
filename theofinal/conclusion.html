					<p>“The fight is far from over, because it is neither won, as some assert, nor lost, as the calamity-ridden declare...” (King 17).  While our semester of service at Mullanphy may be over, our goal from reaching our potential is far from it. There are still many things about ourselves we must learn, and many things we must improve. The goal of making this website, was to inform others outside of our class that they too can have these life-changing experiences similar to ours, and that they should realize that not trying to actualize their full potential as a person would be a mistake, and one that they would regret for the rest of their lives. We wanted to use this page as a medium to get across our own encounters in the space between, and how they served to better us as coaches, but more importantly, as people. </p>
					<p>Whether it be the personal encounters we had in the space between, the self-realizations, or even the fun stories we now have to tell, we can take away something valuable from every little aspect of our service with the students at Mullanphy. These are the things that we wanted to share with everyone we could. </p>
					<p>This class was one of the most impactful all three of us have taken in our short time at SLU, and is one we will remember even after we graduate. While we might not remember what we learned in Calc-2 or the difference between Aristotle and Socrates, we will remember the very personal experiences we had in this course, because they are so integral to the reasons why we came to SLU in the first place. We wanted not only to learn about our respective majors, but we also wanted to learn more about ourselves. Who we really are, what we are really interested in, and most importantly, catching a glimpse of what our full potential can be, and how we can reach it. </p>
					<p>In conclusion, the most important thing we learned this semester wasn’t how to be a better coach, or how to communicate with a younger crowd, it was this one exceptional realization: Participating in sport whether it be through playing or coaching, leads one to take the ideals of bettering oneself and giving their all into everything they do in life, whether it be school, occupation, or even just striving to become the best possible person you can be. While our service may be over, the desire to strive for these ideals has not yet left any of us, and likely never will. What will stick with us is the need to become the best possible versions of ourselves, and spreading the message the you too, should strive for the same thing.</p>
