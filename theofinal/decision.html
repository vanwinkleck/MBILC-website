					<p>Through the completion of this service project, we have learned that reciprocal learning and personal encounters are essential in transforming society and becoming the best version of ourselves. By creating dialogue and listening to the concerns of one another, we are better able to deepen our personal connections as we gain new perspectives on life that we may not have even thought of before. </p>
					<p>The Vatican writes “we see how practicing sports helps the human being to grow because he becomes capable of generating an environment that combines freedom and responsibility, creativity and respect for rules, entertainment and seriousness” (Vatican 3.2). By instilling these values in our coaching tactics we feel that we impacted these children and inspired hope in their lives. SLU’s mission statement focuses on “the pursuit of truth for the greater glory of God and for the service of humanity” which connects to this quote from Rachel Remen as she writes “service is not a relationship between an expert and a problem; it is a human relationship, a work of the heart and soul” (Youth Sport and Spirituality, 254). This quote is significant to SLU’s mission because it conveys that the goal of service is not to solve problems, but to grow as individuals and as communities as we work side-by-side with others from completely different backgrounds. SLU wants its students to holistically develop during their time on campus and the design of this course shares the same objective, which we have experienced through academic learning and in our time spent at Mullanphy. Donald Winnicott defines play as “a creative engagement with the world where our imagination interacts with whatever we find outside ourselves” (Youth Sport and Spirituality, 257). We truly believe this quote ties into the fundamental purposes of SLU’s mission. In this community-based learning class, we have discovered new meanings of sport through our readings and class discussions, and we have also discerned the power of play at Mullanphy Botanical. Through these engagements, we have realized that this course is the first class we have taken at SLU where we can actually experience SLU’s mission personally instead of just reading about the mission on a syllabus or handout.</p>
					<p>Many SLU students might not even be able to tell you what the university’s mission is, in fact, all three of us had only a vague idea when we stepped into class on the first day this semester. Over the course of the semester, we didn’t just read and understand SLU’s mission, but we experienced it personally through our service, and the effect that it can have on the university’s students firsthand. We believe that service is not something you just do for others, but something that you do for yourself as well. The experience of service teaches you things about yourself that you would have never realized otherwise, and helps you to become truly the best person you can be. Realizing your full potential should be the goal of every man and woman in this world, and while very few reach their potential, it would be a tragedy if we all didn’t at least try.  </p>
					<p>We believe that the personal encounters one finds when performing service is something that can be very spiritual, even if one is not religious. Being “spiritual” does not directly mean it has to be religious, it can mean simply that one realizes something bigger than themselves, and puts something other than themself ahead of their own personal desires and wants. And if this is not a direct description of our service experience, than what is? That is why we believe the subject of theology pertains to these connections, and should strive to allow as many people as possible to experience them. Even if someone is not religious, a religious person such as a theologist can convince them that these life-changing experiences exist, and can be easily found if one is willing to put in enough time, effort, and dedication. </p>
