# MBILC-website
A website I made as a final project for a theology class in the fall of 2018. 

I made this website with a template I found on templated.com, however all the changes to existing code and new original code were made by myself.

As a summary of the project, for a theology class two classmates and I spent a semester volunteering at a local grade school, coaching young students in soccer.

As for the website, it was a pretty straightforward project. Mostly using HTML and CSS3, with only a smidge of javascript thrown in.
